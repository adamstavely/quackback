| ID  | Decision                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Status |
| --- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------ |
| D1  | **Fork-only.** Features are not contributed upstream. Upstream PRs are decided **case by case**: the custom-roles-on-REST/MCP fix will **not** be offered (Q18); the 2FA-reset / force-sign-out target guard **will** be offered (Q40). Per-app inbound email is fork-only (Q7). | ✅     |
| D2  | Separate fork migration lineage: `packages/db/drizzle-fork/` + `drizzle.__fork_migrations`, applied after upstream (`02-fork-conventions.md` §3).                                                                                                                                                 | ✅     |
| D3  | Enforce custom roles on the REST API and MCP. Carried permanently as a fork patch (seams R-1…R-5).                                                                                                                                                                                               | ✅     |
| D4  | **Seat limits and paid-plan limits do not apply** to any deployment (Q10, Q14). Plans must not rely on or build seat mechanics.                                                                                                                                                                    | ✅     |
| D-X1 | **All fork UI inherits each app's branding** (owner, round 2): hub pages, banners (incl. the external embed) and fork panels use the app's own design tokens (`brandingConfig` + `customCss` via upstream's theme generator), so branding set once in an app applies everywhere in that app (`02-fork-conventions.md` §11). | ✅     |
| D-E1 | **Intranet-only deployment** (owner, round 3): every app, portal, widget, the control tower and all end users live on the company intranet. **All users are authenticated employees**: sign-in is enforced **both** at the network edge (SSO proxy/VPN) **and** by Quackback's own SSO login. | ✅     |
| D-E2 | **No outbound internet connections** from any component (no third-party SaaS, CDNs, public AI APIs, public email services or webhooks to the internet). Only intranet services and AWS services reachable privately (VPC endpoints / PrivateLink) may be used. | ✅     |
| D-E3 | **Portal setting = public visibility, anonymous posting/voting OFF, SSO-only sign-in** (owner chose option (a) over private + domain allow-list). Supersedes D-N5 ("all portals private"). Protection against unauthenticated readers relies on the edge SSO + Quackback SSO (D-E1). | ✅     |
| D-E4 | **All end users are employees**; there are no external requesters. | ✅     |
| D-E5 | **AI features run on AWS Bedrock (via PrivateLink) and/or the company's internal LLM proxy** — never a public AI API. Covers the Quinn assistant, Ask AI, embeddings/search, classification and summaries. | ✅     |
| D-E6 | The internal LLM proxy is **OpenAI-compatible** (`/v1/chat/completions`, `/v1/embeddings`). Default AI path: point Quackback's OpenAI client at the proxy (which may itself front Bedrock); a native Bedrock adapter is only built if the proxy can't serve a required model. | ✅     |

## Control tower (`20-control-tower.md`)

| ID    | Decision                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Status |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------ |
| D-C1  | **Separate app** `apps/control-tower/`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | ✅     |
| D-C2  | **Every action auditable to the human.** The tower acts through each app's MCP endpoint with the admin's own OAuth token; dual audit (tower + app-native).                                                                                                                     | ✅     |
| D-C3  | AWS managed Postgres: **one shared RDS/Aurora cluster**, one database + one login role per app (Q4). Pooled DSN → RDS Proxy; direct DSN → writer endpoint.                                                                                                                  | ✅     |
| D-C4  | One fleet root key in AWS Secrets Manager (KMS); never held by the tower; rotation via `v<gen>`.                                                                                                                                                                               | ✅     |
| D-C5  | Fleet role → app role mapping (Q1, default): owner → app **Admin**; agent → **"Fleet Agent"**; observer → **"Fleet Observer"**. Generalised by D-C9.                                                                                                                         | 🟡     |
| D-C6  | Apps on **subdomains of one fleet domain** with an ACM wildcard certificate; custom domains per app later (Q3).                                                                                                                                                                | ✅     |
| D-C7  | **Identity provider:** a standards-compliant **OAuth2/OIDC or SAML** provider, vendor not fixed (Q2). The tower and every app must support **both OIDC and SAML**; group/claim → role mapping is configuration, not code.                                                     | ✅     |
| D-C8  | **Backups at fleet (cluster) level** only; no per-app restore requirement (Q5).                                                                                                                                                                                                | ✅     |
| D-C9  | Teams need **different feature levels per persona** in both the tower and each app dashboard (Q10) ⇒ tower authorization is **configurable role bundles** (observer/agent/owner are only seeds), each mapped to a tenant custom role.                                        | ✅     |
| D-C10 | **One shared S3 bucket** with per-app prefix isolation (Q6).                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | ✅     |
| D-C11 | **Per-app inbound email is required**, built in the fork (Q7): per-app inbound signing secret derived from the fleet root key, like app secrets.                                                                                                                             | ✅     |
| D-C12 | **No per-app consent screens** (Q8, Q9): the tower is a trusted first-party client (`skip_consent`); a "connect all apps" flow obtains each app's token via silent SSO sign-in. Attribution unaffected (the human still authenticates).                                      | ✅     |
| D-C15 | **The tower owns the entire app role set of every tower-managed person** (owner, round 4; resolves second-pass R2-3). At each sync the tower sets their complete role set in every app; roles granted locally by an app admin are removed. There are no locally adopted roles for managed principals. Unmanaged people (not in the tower) are untouched. Supersedes the O-C8 question. | ✅     |
| D-C16 | **The IdP supports SCIM or a directory API** (owner, round 4; R2-4). Revocation is driven by directory sync, not by login-time claims. Disabling a person produces a tenant-level denial on every auth path (sessions, OAuth/MCP tokens, API keys they created), independent of grant bookkeeping. The revocation bound must be stated as target vs hard maximum with polling/queue/retry budget. | ✅     |

## RBAC / personas (`10-rbac-persona-extensions.md`)

| ID   | Decision                                                                                                                                                                          | Status |
| ---- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------ |
| D-R1 | **No seat-exempt / viewer mechanism** — seat limits don't apply (D4). Former Phase 4 dropped.                                                                                      | ✅     |
| D-R2 | Two-part permission keys only.                                                                                                                                                    | ✅     |
| D-R3 | Personas (UX, dev, stakeholders, Tier 1/2/3) each need **different feature levels** in the app dashboard and the tower (Q10). All are dashboard teammates.                      | ✅     |
| D-R4 | **Multi-role ("multiple hats") is in scope** (Q11).                                                                                                                                | ✅     |
| D-R5 | **No board-scoped teammates** (Q12).                                                                                                                                               | ✅     |
| D-R6 | **Strict read-only teammates, including no commenting** (Q13) ⇒ Phase 1b (teammate comment gate + `comment.create` key) in scope on dashboard, REST and MCP paths.              | ✅     |
| D-R7 | Fleet Observer may hold fleet-wide `conversation.view_all` / `ticket.view_all` (Q15).                                                                                             | ✅     |
| D-R8 | API-key permission backfill: dry-run report, then explicit apply (Q16).                                                                                                           | ✅     |
| D-R9 | Team-scoped grants reuse upstream's reserved `principal_role_assignments.team_id`; watch for upstream semantics at each merge (Q17).                                            | ✅     |

## Tiered support (`30-tiered-support.md`)

| ID    | Decision                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Status |

| D-A2  | Requester ≠ approver, enforced (Q31).                                                                                                                                                                                       | ✅     |
| D-A3  | Approver must hold `account.execute` **through a team-scoped grant** on the owning tier's team (`canInTeam`); no workspace-wide fallback (staff review A1). Team-scoped RBAC (`10-…` Phase 2) is a prerequisite of account actions. | ✅     |
| D-A4  | Managers do **not** get account-action permissions (Q34).                                                                                                                                                                  | ✅     |

| D-A6  | **Extensible without code per action** (Q29): per-app actions are configuration (and/or advertised by the app's API), each with a **minimum tier**; permission keys are generic, not one per action.                      | ✅     |
| D-A7  | Quinn (AI) may invoke account actions **only if enabled per workspace; off by default** (Q39).                                                                                                                             | ✅     |

| D-A10 | Owner/Admin break-glass approval, audited, never self-approval (Q33).                                                                                                                                                      | ✅     |

| D-A13 | Requests expire after **72 hours**; requester notified (Q38).                                                                                                                                                              | ✅     |
| D-A14 | Offer upstream a guard so 2FA reset / force sign-out cannot target the owner or higher-ranked roles (Q40).                                                                                                                 | ✅     |

| O-R3  | 10   | Owner and Admin hold every permission by design, so "only the UX team scores" means UX Team + Owner/Admin. Acceptable, or add a fork-side exclusion so even Admins can't score?                                           | UX Team + Owner/Admin                          |
| O-R4  | 10   | The Dev Team can't be limited to drafting changelog entries: upstream's single `changelog.manage` covers create, edit and publish. Grant full `changelog.manage` to Dev Team, or leave changelog out of Dev Team?        | Grant `changelog.manage`                       |
| O-R5  | 10   | Strict read-only (D-R6) blocks commenting, but voting and emoji reactions by read-only teammates stay ungated. Also block those?                                                                                          | Leave ungated                                  |
| O-T15 | 30   | Should requesters who only have hub access (on a private portal) see "Find an answer" (help-center search and Ask AI)?                                                                                                     | Hidden                                         |
| O-T14 | 30   | When an email-only requester signs in to the hub, merge in earlier requests whose sender failed email authentication (weak DMARC), keeping an "unverified" badge on them?                                                | Yes, with badge                                |
| O-A3  | 40   | Beyond break-glass **approval** (D-A10), may Owner/Admin also **run** any account action directly regardless of tier?                                                                                                     | Yes, audited                                   |
| O-A4  | 40   | Should actions that a connected app newly advertises arrive **disabled** until an admin enables them?                                                                                                                     | Disabled                                       |
| O-A5  | 40   | Which customer attributes (beyond email, name and external user id) may be sent to a connected app? Per-app allow-list.                                                                                                     | None (empty allow-list)                        |


## Raised by the staff review (owner input needed; plans use the stated default meanwhile)

| ID    | Plan | Question | Default in plan |
| ----- | ---- | -------- | --------------- |
| O-R6  | 10 | Should an API key created by a team-restricted agent act only on its creator's teams' tickets and conversations (needs extra upstream seams), or stay workspace-wide with no ticket/conversation access at all? | Workspace-wide, no ticket/conversation access |
| O-R7  | 10 | Upstream lets any teammate with `conversation.view` open any conversation by ID, while ticket reads by ID become team-limited. Keep upstream's conversation behaviour for Tier agents? | Keep upstream behaviour |
| O-C3  | 20 | Accept one shared edge-to-app HMAC secret for inbound mail delivery, while reply-address keys stay per app? | Accept |
| O-C8  | 20 | ~~Local edits vs tower~~ — **answered by D-C15** (tower owns the whole role set). | — |
| O-C9  | 20 | Maximum delay for an IdP disable/group removal to take effect in every app — a target or a hard maximum? (Mechanism is now D-C16.) | 15-minute target |
| O-C10 | 20 | Tier bundles need an explicit per-app team mapping maintained in the tower, and grant nothing in apps without one. Acceptable? | Yes |
| O-T16 | 30 | Are tiers an operational routing convention (any agent with ticket access can still act), or a strict read/write restriction per tier? | Routing convention; escalators become read-only after handoff |
| O-T17 | 30 | Does escalating a ticket count as its first response for SLA purposes? | No |
| O-T18 | 30 | When a blocked email-only lead is claimed by a signed-in requester, how does the block carry over? | Block moves to the user (read-only; can't reply, file or rate); lead kept as a block anchor for future mail |
| O-A9  | 40 | If a ticket moves teams after an account-action request, does approval follow the ticket's current team (re-routing if its tier is too low)? | Yes, follows current team |
| O-A10 | 40 | Which changes invalidate an approval and require re-approval? | Any change to the customer's identifiers or allowed attributes, inputs, app base URL, config or signing-secret version, or action definition version |
| O-A11 | 40 | May a customer known only by email (no account) be an account-action target? | Only after they verify by signing in to the help hub |
| O-A12 | 40 | Reuse the existing `ticket_note_added` notification type for request-expiry notices (no new notification type)? | Yes |
| O-P11 | 50 | After a framework switch, decide "needs re-scoring" once, from each post's status at the switch, or re-check it from the current status every time? | Once, at the switch |
| O-P12 | 50 | Should posts keeping an old-framework score show it frozen as it was at the switch, or keep recalculating it from new votes with the old formula? | Frozen |
| O-N10 | 60 | Is it acceptable for a new, changed or resolved **status incident** to take up to 5 minutes to reach an already-open banner (announcements themselves are instant)? | Yes |
| O-N11 | 60 | On internal apps, should the embedded banner use only the app's theme colours and font, not its custom CSS (custom CSS applies in portal and hub)? | Yes |
| O-N12 | 60 | Do you also want a banner strip inside the support widget panel? | No (reserved, deferred) |

D-N7 default (after D-E3): on internal apps every employee sees "Everyone" announcements without being identified;
segment-targeted items appear only when the host app identifies the user, and then match the portal.
D-T8 default: higher-tier agents outside the owning team, and Managers, may de-escalate.


## Raised by the intranet revisions (owner input needed; plans use the stated default meanwhile)

| ID    | Plan | Question | Default in plan |
| ----- | ---- | -------- | --------------- |
| O-C11 | 20 | Incoming support email: one catch-all fleet mailbox on the internal mail server, read by a fork mail router that routes each message to its app (upstream IMAP can't run per app under pooled tenancy), or one mailbox per app? | One fleet mailbox + router |
| O-C12 | 20 | SSO-only sign-in: is it acceptable that domain SSO **enforcement** switches on after each app's first real SSO sign-in (upstream requires a successful SSO login first), and that fleet ops hold each app's break-glass recovery codes in Secrets Manager? | Yes |
| O-C13 | 20 | May the tower, provisioner and mail router reach apps through a private DNS zone that bypasses the edge SSO proxy (same hostnames; they authenticate with their own tokens)? | Yes |
| O-C14 | 20 | Which internal domain and private certificate authority should the fleet use for app hostnames? | ⏳ needs your values |
| O-T19 | 30 | If the company IdP doesn't send `email_verified`, may Quackback trust an email on the verified company domain that the IdP owns? (Otherwise earlier email requests can't be claimed at sign-in.) | Yes |
| O-T20 | 30 | Is a plain nav link "Help hub" (not translated) enough, avoiding an upstream edit? | Yes |
| O-A12 | 40 | Connected internal apps must use HTTPS with a certificate from the company CA (trusted via `NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS`), with no option to skip certificate checks. OK? | Yes |
| O-A13 | 40 | Apps resolve the customer's account in this order: SSO subject → employee ID (if you map it from an IdP claim) → external user ID → verified email. OK? | Yes |
| O-N14 | 60 | Embedded banners on internal apps: "Everyone" announcements show to anyone reaching the app without identifying them; segment-targeted ones only when the host app identifies the user. OK? | Yes |
| O-N15 | 60 | The edge SSO proxy must let six banner embed paths through without Quackback's login cookie (script, "everyone" feed, live-update stream, fonts, and two optional identity endpoints) — or use a shared cookie domain across internal apps. Which? | Proxy exemption for those paths |

**Ask of the mail team:** have the internal mail server stamp an `Authentication-Results` header on inbound mail; without
it Quackback treats every internal email as unverified.


## Raised by the second-pass revisions (owner input needed; plans use the stated default meanwhile)

| ID    | Plan | Question | Default in plan |
| ----- | ---- | -------- | --------------- |
| O-R8  | 10/20 | Turn on a tenant-side entitlement lease so revocation becomes a **hard maximum** (lease length + 5 min), rather than a 15-minute target? | Off; 4 hours if turned on |
| O-R9  | 10 | Block app admins from changing a tower-managed person's role (needs an upstream edit), or allow it and revert at the next sync with a `drift_reverted` report? | Allow + revert + report |
| O-C15 | 20 | A tenant that must stay on an older upstream release has to be **suspended** (the serving path catches every served tenant up to the image). Acceptable, or must some keep serving on an older image? | One serving image; suspend held-back tenants |
| O-C16 | 20 | Can the mail team deliver one copy per recipient and **strip any inbound copy of, then stamp,** a dedicated routing header? | Yes (validated by V-9); otherwise one mailbox per app |
| O-T21 | 30 | When the sweep finds a ticket/conversation team that disagrees with the last recorded assignment, restore the recorded team or adopt the unrecorded write? | Restore and alert |
| O-T22 | 30 | Refuse a human's assignment made from a stale screen after the pair has been escalated? (Needs an expected-team input on upstream's assign.) | No — allowed as a recorded manual override |
| O-T23 | 30 | Accept that a note or system message can repeat if a worker stalls longer than twice its 30-second lease mid-call? | Accept |
| O-A14 | 40 | Can a disabled employee still be the **target** of an account action (e.g. to deprovision them)? | Yes |
| O-A15 | 40 | If the requester is disabled after approval but before the action is sent, cancel the request? | Yes |
| O-A16 | 40 | If an escalation is already in flight when a request closes, let it complete (ticket stays on the higher tier)? | Yes |
| O-A17 | 40 | Is a signed conformance-kit attestation (plus live probes) required and sufficient to enable a connected app? | Yes, required and audited |
| O-N16 | 60 | Is a 5-minute recovery bound acceptable when a live banner update is lost (normal updates arrive in under 2 s)? | Yes |

Verification tasks recorded in the plans (not decisions): RDS Proxy pinning (20 V-1); MCP token lifetimes and `skip_consent` behaviour (20 V-4, V-8); AWS S3 through the registry's storage record, which today only accepts `provider: 'r2'` and static keys (20 V-7); whether `/api/widget/kb-ask` respects private-portal/help-center audience rules (30); banner stream limiter sizing (60 N-11).
