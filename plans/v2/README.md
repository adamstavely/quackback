# Fork Plans — v2

v2 supersedes the original plans in `plans/v1/`. It fixes the issues found in the v1 review, records the
owner's decisions, and puts every feature under one set of fork conventions so that upstream Quackback
releases keep merging cleanly.

```

1. **Foundations** (`02-fork-conventions.md` §3, §3.3a, §10): the fork migration lineage **and its production rollout** (image contents, `fork-migrate` with catalogue reconciliation, fork schema floor, suspended-tenant catch-up), the `fork_settings` table, the fork drift check, the shared seams F-1…F-11 (plus the fork-owned `Dockerfile.fork`), and `SEAMS.md`. Every later phase depends on this. **Fleet infrastructure and SSO spikes** (RDS Proxy, S3 via the registry, OIDC/SAML broker, no-consent OAuth, mail edge) start early, in parallel.
2. **10 RBAC.** Phase 1a (custom roles enforced on REST/MCP) is a security fix and a prerequisite for the tower's authorization model. Team-scoped RBAC must ship before tiers (D-T4).
3. **50 Prioritization.** Independent and lowest risk. A good first feature for proving out the conventions.
4. **30 Tiered support**, then **40 Account actions**, which needs tiers and team-scoped RBAC.
5. **60 Announcements**: the portal banner and embed can ship any time after Foundations.
6. **20 Control tower**: provisioner and pooled tenancy first, then the tower app. Its full product surfaces wait until the permission and tool contracts (10 Phase 1a, the capability → tool → permission table in 20) are proven by tests. Its announcements surface comes last.

## Status

All documents are **plans only**. Nothing is implemented. In `01-decisions.md`, ✅ items are decided, 🟡 items are
**adopted defaults** the plans are built on (the owner may still override them), and ⏳ items block the phases that
depend on them.

**Scope honesty.** Several capabilities arrive in later phases: workflow/macro escalation, non-close stage emails,
Quinn account actions and the tower portfolio view. An early release with manual escalation or a local-only banner
does **not** deliver the full requested capability set, and release notes must say so.

**Upgrade promise.** The fork is a *maintained, tested fork that can take upstream releases*, not a conflict-free
one. Every upgrade follows `02-fork-conventions.md` §7, including semantic review, negative authorization tests and
a populated-database upgrade rehearsal.
